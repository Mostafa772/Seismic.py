# Python Seismic Reimplementation

Python Seismic is a Python reimplementation of the [Seismic library](https://github.com/TusKANNy/seismic), originally written in Rust. While the Rust version is optimized and robust, this Python version focuses on replicating the core functionality and making the library accessible to Python developers. **Note:** This implementation is fully functional but not yet optimized for performance.

## Overview

**Python Seismic** brings the core functionality of the original Rust-based seismic library to Python. This project:
- Demonstrates how to translate well-written Rust code into Python.
- Serves as a base for future performance optimizations and additional features.

---

## Features

- **Core Functionality:** Implements key operations from the original seismic library.
- **Pythonic API:** Designed for ease of integration and use in Python projects.
- **Modular Structure:** Easily extend or modify components.
- **Documentation:** Inline code documentation and usage examples to assist developers.

---

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7 or higher
- A virtual environment is recommended (e.g., `venv` or `conda`).

### Installation Steps

1. **Clone the Repository:**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/python-seismic.git
   cd python-seismic
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies:**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## Usage

You can find an example in "demo.py". 

## Performance Considerations

> **Note:** This Python version replicates the intended functionality of the Rust implementation but is not optimized for performance.  
>
> **Tips for performance improvements:**
> - Identify and refactor bottlenecks.
> - Consider contributing optimizations.
> - Compare performance with the original Rust version if needed.
